great trip :) thanks for making christmas special for me
deeply sad to book the flight
top quality experience
sad but great thrill
sad and great
sad
happy
i loved your  service
worst service ever provided
my wife didnt liked the food at all 
kids were delighted receiving the christmas gift during the flight
torned seat and poor service :(
i got sick and stomachache after eating the food provided which made my trip really worst to which i was looking for since alot of months. :( :_(
it seems to be good product
fuck it! this is the shittiest thing i've ever worked on!
